> Concepts & usage

## Overview

The interface is the middle point where two ends meet. The interval between sticks. The magical place where something becomes something else: where electricity becomes sound, and vice versa; where words become compute, and compute becomes pixels; where machine and Man meet.

In programming, an interface is where an object may be connected with. As input, the interface is what the object needs, and more generally understands; as output, it's what the object will or may do and say. You use it everyday when you call something with known argumentsâ€”a simple URL issued in an address bar, a password, and yes a function or class. You know the power of interfaces that let you change the implementation on any side without impacting the other, as long as you preserve the interface. Zooming out at the module level, the interface becomes the way to interact with those objects, from simple `import` statements to more involved packaging, distribution, and deployment.

This is where `1i` comes in. It brings **the power of the 1-liner to perform all this boilerplate work needed for packaging, distribution, and deployment**. All of which generally sits way outside the compentency realm and core skill set of the programmer.

Why should you have to care how `pip` or `cargo` want things besides application design? You can, and you should if that's your thing, but generally the beauty of programming lies in the interface between some `def func(â€¦)` in the code and a terminal `$ func â€¦` command that does the thing. Everything in-between these two steps is hinderance at best, obstacles at worst. 1i intends to solve that problem in the most general manner possibleâ€”ideally, for all languages, to all platforms, with all package managers. This is obviously a community effort by principle, wherein one circumstantial ambassador of each combination comes to fix what's broken since the last one came. It's the textbook example of doing it one time and one time only for the entire population of programmers worldwide. And it's hopefully a meaningful way to help grow said population, by onboarding many more who otherwise couldn't, or wouldn't contribute.
